# Bologna Creative City.

## 1.Introduction

Bologna is one of the 246 cityes of the UNESCO Creative City Network. This project, founded in 2004, has as objective to create links between cityes that find in creative industires the motor for sustainable urban development and implamentation of structure to promote citiezenship equality. A 'Creative City' is evaluated in terms of 6 parameters: 

* **Soustainabel Grouth and Enterprenourship** -- Cities can build more equitable and sustainable economic growth patterns by promoting creativity. The creative sector drives the transition to new economic ecosystems based on knowledge and innovation in post-industrial contexts. Jobs developed in the industry are frequently better integrated into local economies, less susceptible to global movement, and more favorable to social inclusion.

* **Knowledge and Skils** -- The labor market is changing dramatically, due to technology as well as other issues such as climate change. While the effects of this big shift on skills, income, and the nature of our work are hard to predict, educational institutions must keep up. Creative abilities are essential in this context for expanding and adapting educational services in this new climate, as well as supporting the creative industry and intercultural dialogue. In the future, the creative economy is anticipated to become one of the key sectors for employment development, providing new chances for the most disadvantaged members of society. Predicting future skill requirements and modifying educational institutions, particularly in the creative industry, are thus top considerations.

* **Inclusion, Equality and Dialog** -- Culture may establish the framework for discussion, mutual understanding, and reconciliation in a global society. Where cities face serious concerns of social and geographic segregation, culture may help disadvantaged populations have their voices heard in the political realm. The creative industry encourages new kinds of intergenerational conversation and promotes gender equity and inclusion by speaking to society's values and future ambitions.

* **Urban Regeneration** -- The rate and size of urbanization, along with the environmental issue, provide a significant challenge to the planning tactics used in previous decades. Cities all across the globe are being challenged to find innovative ways to shelter, transport, feed, and educate an ever-increasing population while also decreasing their environmental impact (new urban narratives). In this setting, the creative industry offers a fresh perspective that encourages inventive thinking and inspires new ways of thinking about future cities.

* **Ecologcal Transition and Resilience** -- Cities have taken initiatives in committing to environmental sustainability, setting climate resilience at the center of municipal plans, building sustainable low-carbon paths, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The creative industry may stimulate capacity to transform to stimulate ownership of climate change challenges, assist public behavioral change, spark production and consumption pattern adaptation, and encourage sustainable use of natural resources.

* **Social Innovation and Citizienship** -- The creative industry is fostering new types of citizenship and involvement in cities all around the world. Public authorities are increasingly including citizens in co-designing and co-delivering public policy, leveraging digital technologies and creative techniques such as design thinking. Through open innovation processes, open methods and the innovative use of technology can also offer new routes to developing answers to municipal difficulties. 

All the parameters are covering some of European's Soustainable Grouth principle. it's included: gender equity, reduced inequality, good health and well-being, sustainable cities and communities, climate action etc. In this panorama Bologna distinguished in the Soustainabel Grouth and Enterprenourship principle. Thanks to initiative dedicated to creative industires, Bologna sets a strategic lever for economic attractiveness that in the midewhile stimulate urban regeneration. In 2010, the municipality has launched IncrediBol! is a sustainable mechanism for supporting creative entrepreneurship.

It acts as a jumping-off point for young creative entrepreneurs to develop their businesses. It stimulates open communication and knowledge exchange, supports the structuring of the local economic fabric, encourages the internationalization of developing enterprises, and offers them with opportunities at the European level, all while relying on a public-private network. Professionals who profit from this project will be able to quickly access inexpensive business space supplied by the municipality, which will help to revitalize neglected areas. Since its inception, IncrediBol! has aided over 95 creative start-ups in a wide range of sectors, including design, music, and media arts.

The goal of this project is to create an application that, through open data, will describe the actual situation of Bologna in the Creative City panorama in order to make visible and explanable the improovmet of the city of Bologna thenks to initiative like IncrediBol!, and in which field Bologna can improove in order to overcome possible issue rilevated.
