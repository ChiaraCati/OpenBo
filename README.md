# Bologna Creative City.

## 1.Introduction

Bologna is one of the 246 cityes of the UNESCO Creative City Network. This project, founded in 2004, has as objective to create links between cityes that find in creative industires the motor for sustainable urban development and implamentation of structure to promote citiezenship equality. A 'Creative City' is evaluated in terms of 6 parameters: 

* **Soustainabel Grouth and Enterprenourship** -- Across the world, creativity offers strategic paths for cities to develop more inclusive and sustainable economic growth patterns. In post-industrial situations, the creative sector drives conversion to new economic ecosystems, focused on knowledge and innovation. Jobs created in the sector are often more embedded in local economies, less vulnerable to relocation in a global context and more conducive to social inclusion.

* **Knowledge and Skils** -- The labour market is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by automation but also other factors such as climate change. It is estimated that 60% of all jobs have at least 30% of activities that are automatable, based on technologies available today. While the impact of this major shift on skills, wages and the nature of our jobs is hard to estimate, educational systems are to keep pace with this evolution. In this context, creative skills are essential to evolving and adapting educational provision in this new environment, while also supporting the creative sector and intercultural dialogue. The creative economy will likely become one of the leading sector for job creation in the future – together with those linked with ecological transition – opening up new opportunities for the most vulnerable segments of the population. The development of digital platforms will also make knowledge more accessible and content more flexible and user-oriented. Anticipating the skills needed in the future and adapting education systems, notably in the creative sector, are therefore major priorities.

* **Inclusion, Equality and Dialog** -- In a global context where new dividing lines are emerging, culture can lay the groundwork for dialogue, mutual understanding or reconciliation. Where cities face critical issues of social and spatial segregation, culture helps bring the voice of vulnerable communities into the public realm. Speaking to societies’ values and visions of the future, the creative sector also stimulates new forms of intergenerational dialogue and drives gender equity and inclusion.

* **Urban Regeneration** -- The pace and magnitude of urban growth, together with the environmental crisis, clearly challenge the planning strategies conducted over the last decades. Around the world, cities are called upon to forge new solutions to house, transport, feed and educate an increasing population, while also reducing its ecological footprint (new urban narratives). In that context, the creative sector brings a fresh outlook that spurs imaginative thinking and inspire new mindsets to imagine the cities of tomorrow. How can we re-use and adapt existing buildings to meet contemporary expectations? How can we design public spaces in ways that reflect cultural diversity and facilitate social interactions? How can housing and urban services provide well-being and be compatible with cultural practices?

* **Ecologcal Transition and Resilience** -- Cities have become active players in committing to environmental sustainability, placing climate resilience at the heart of municipal strategies, developing sustainable low-carbon pathways or taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The creative sector can boost imaginative thinking to foster ownership of issues related to climate change, support behavioral change among the public, spark the adaptation of production and consumption patterns and encourage sustainable use of natural resources.

* **Social Innovation and Citizienship** -- In cities around the world, the creative sector is stimulating new forms of citizenship and participation. Building on digital technology and creative methodologies such as design thinking, public authorities are engaging more and more citizens in co-designing and co-delivering public policies. Open approaches and the creative use of technologies can also offer new paths to develop solutions to solving city challenges through open innovation processes. These inputs from the creative sector also bring out new possibilities to provide tailored urban services for citizens, addressing the specific needs and constraints of targeted categories within the population, such as youth, the elderly or the handicapped.

All the parameters are covering some of European's Soustainable Grouth principle. it's included: gender equity, reduced inequality, good health and well-being, sustainable cities and communities, climate action etc. In this panorama Bologna distinguished in the Soustainabel Grouth and Enterprenourship principle. Thanks to initiative dedicated to creative industires, Bologna sets a strategic lever for economic attractiveness that in the midewhile stimulate urban regeneration. In 2010, the municipality has launched IncrediBol! is a sustainable mechanism for supporting creative entrepreneurship.

Through regular calls for applications as well as access to trainings and consulting, it serves as springboard for young creative entrepreneurs to launch their start-ups. Building on a public-private network, it fosters open dialogue and knowledge sharing, supports the structuring of the local economic fabric, encourages the internationalization of emerging companies and provides them with opportunities at the European level. The professionals benefiting from this project can
easily access affordable business premises provided by the municipality, which in turn contributes to breathing new life into deprived neighbourhoods. Since its launch, IncrediBol! has successfully helped over 95 creativity- led start-ups in all creative fields, from design to music and media arts.

The goal of this project is to create an application that, through open data, will describe the actual situation of Bologna in the Creative City panorama in order to make visible and explanable the improovmet of the city of Bologna thenks to initiative like Impossible, and in which field Bologna can improove in order to overcome possible issue rilevated.
